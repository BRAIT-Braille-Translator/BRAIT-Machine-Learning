# BRAIT-Machine-Learning

# This Contains what Machine Learning's Team Do 
The job of Machine Learning team is to learn and make machine learning model of Braille Translator

## 1. Search Information Source Related to Braille Translator Project
We have to read the journal or the other resources to gain more knowledge about Braille Translator

## 2. Search Dataset 
We collect the data from the GitHub repository "AeyeAlliance"
### Dataset Resource
- [GitHub](https://github.com/HelenGezahegn/aeye-alliance/tree/master/Raw%20Data/Unlabelled%2C%20Cropped%20Letters/Wan-Chun's%20Chars/More%20Chars)

## 3. Data Preparation
After collecting the dataset, we do preparation data by cleaning the image that not suitable for our model, such as deleting and crop the image that still can be use
### Link To Dataset
- [Braille Dataset] (https://github.com/BRAIT-Braille-Translator/BRAIT-Machine-Learning/tree/main/dataset)

## 4. Preprocessing Data
We use image augmentation to the original images to create additional training samples to expanding the training data with diverse variations and to reduce overfiting

## 5. Create Models and Training the Data

## 6. Evaluate The Model

## 7. Test The Model
